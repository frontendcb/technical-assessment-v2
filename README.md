# Cleverbridge Technical Assessment

## Objective
Implement a marketing incentive popup modal that
* triggers when the user's mouse moves near the top of the document window (within 15-20 pixels)
* presents the customer a discounted price in order to keep them on the page
* applies a discounted 'coupon' to the checkout if the user accepts it

## User Stories
As a seller, I want to...
* trigger a popup modal for customers whose mouses are navigating toward the top of the window to exit the page
* offer the customer a discount in this popup to keep them on the page
* mask the main page with a semi-transparent overlay that covers the entire page behind the modal content

As a shopper, I want to...
* click a call to action (CTA) to accept the discount offer.
* click a different CTA to reject the discount offer.
  * I can also use an exit button or click the modal overlay to dismiss the popup.
* see my discount applied to the cart total if I accept it.
* see text in the cart confirming my coupon was successfully applied if I accept it.
